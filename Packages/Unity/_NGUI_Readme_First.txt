NGUI Notice:


If you already have NGUI in your project, you don't need to import

the NGUI distributed package.


If you don't have NGUI, import ngui_distribution.unitypackage into

your project.


After importing packages, it is a good idea to reopen your project

in Unity as you may see some bogus errors.


NGUI License Notice:

The following NGUI distributed package is included for the examples.


Here is a snippet of the license terms as written on the NGUI site.

"It's intended for internal, evaluational and/or educational use.

You can also freely use it, or the much smaller NGUI Distribution

version in your own Asset Store-bound packages, provided that you

don't modify the contents of the NGUI folder beyond the removal of

items you don't need, and clearly state that the contents of the

NGUI folder are the work of Tasharen Entertainment."
